    <p>Ninety-five percent of British Columbia (BC) is Crown land, owned by the people of BC and regulated by the provincial government, whose strict legal policies and procedures must be adhered to in order to harvest wood. Coupled with the fact that all of BC is on the unceded territories of Indigenous people, the ability to supply logs to a sawmill requires collaboration and strong relationships. <strong>Dan Macmaster</strong> will be discussing the unique process that British Columbian foresters go through to procure logs for sawmills and the importance of addressing multiple objectives when harvesting on Crown land.</p>

In his current role as Vaagen&rsquo;s Fibre Manager, he manages all forestry activities and procures logs for the sawmill.
